## Overview

This documentation works through increasingly complex use cases. It is discouraged to open the CDAF code and try to determine it's purpose from the code (although it's open source, so you're most welcome). The framework uses a significant amount of dependeny injection, and without an understanding of the purpose, the code will be quite difficult to follow.

## _Geared for Enterprise DevOps_

The framework origin is within Enterprises, deploying production systems for internal and external consumption. Although CDAF is used for product shipping, i.e. the framework is used to deliver itself, this is not it's primary purpose.
